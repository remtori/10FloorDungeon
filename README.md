# 10 Floor Dungeon (for now) 
Gotta be vanila without help of resource pack! Well ... maybe just a language pack that support higher level enchantment
___
## Random ideas (will be categorize later)
- Random generated structure with broken portal (which can be fix) to go to 1 main dungeon
- Can be update from previous dungeon
## Dungeon
- Floor based dungeon
- Auto generated base on world seed
- Each floor has different block pallet / theme
- Each floor has a floor master which need to be defeated to go deeper in the dungeon
- Boss / mobs on lower floor are stronger than the upper
- Floor 5, 10, ... has the boss ways stronger than other floor
- Locate at a fixed location - can be define when first load
- Dungeon progress will be saved on each player
- Once the floor master has been defeated it will respawn after 100 minecraft days (1d9h20m IRL) or can be spawn by special ritual
- Exit portal at the begining, the end and in the middle of each floor
## Player
- Will be set to adventure mode
- 
## Traps
- Floating stone on top of lava lake with some fake ones
## Floor Theme
1. Grassy - junglly - vines - cobblly - dirty
2. cobble - andersite - sprute plank - gravel - stone
3. 
## Monster
- NO CREAPER ALLOWED
- Many different class of monster
- Will has stronger equipment and _maybe_ special ability
- Will has custom loot will just be raw material (which can be use to craft special equipment @Mojang, please make custom recipe NBT tags compatible)
